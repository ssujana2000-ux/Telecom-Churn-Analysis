📊 KPI Summary

The dashboard tracks key telecom churn metrics including total customers, churn rate, churned customers, average tenure, and revenue impact. It also measures revenue lost due to churn, refund amounts, and average revenue per customer. Customer behavior is analyzed across tenure groups, contract types, age segments, offers, and churn reasons to identify high-risk segments and revenue drivers.

🔍 Business Insights Summary

Customer churn is highest among early-tenure customers and those on month-to-month contracts. Competitor-related reasons are the primary drivers of churn, often linked to pricing, speed, and device offerings. Customers requesting refunds show higher churn risk, while retention offers significantly reduce churn. A small group of high-value customers contributes to a large share of revenue loss, highlighting the need for targeted retention strategies.
